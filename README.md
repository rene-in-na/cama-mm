## How It Works

The bot uses a **Glicko-2 rating system** for team balancing. Players are matched to create fair teams that minimize skill difference while optimizing role assignments.

- Teams are balanced using Glicko-2 ratings (or MMR as fallback)
- OpenSkill Plackett-Luce provides an alternative rating weighted by fantasy performance
- Role-based optimization ensures players are matched to their preferred positions
- Off-role penalties encourage proper role distribution
- Win/loss records update player ratings after each match
- Captain's Draft mode allows player-selected teams with coinflip mechanics

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository or navigate to the project directory**

2. **Create virtual environment and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   uv venv
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Set up Discord Bot:**
   - Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Create a new application
   - Go to "Bot" section and create a bot
   - Copy the bot token
   - Enable the following Privileged Gateway Intents:
     - MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT
     - SERVER MEMBERS INTENT

4. **Configure Bot Permissions:**
   - In the OAuth2 > URL Generator section, select:
     - Scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`
     - Permissions: View Channels, Send Messages, Manage Messages, Create Public Threads, Send Messages in Threads, Pin Messages, Manage Threads, Embed Links, Read Message History, Use External Emojis, Use External Stickers, Add Reactions

5. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a file named `.env` in the project root (same folder as `bot.py`)
   - Add your Discord bot token and admin allowlist (comma-separated Discord user IDs):
     ```
     DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
     ADMIN_USER_IDS=123456789012345678,234567890123456789
     ```
     If `ADMIN_USER_IDS` is empty, no one is treated as an allowlisted admin for commands like `/addfake`.
   - Optional variables you can include:
     ```
     DB_PATH=/path/to/cama_shuffle.db   # overrides the default sqlite file
     OPENDOTA_API_KEY=your_opendota_key  # unlocks the 1200 req/min rate limit
     STEAM_API_KEY=your_steam_api_key    # enables Valve API match enrichment
     DIG_CHANNEL_ID=123456789012345678   # gates /dig commands and routes output to this channel
     ```
     Both default to sane values (`cama_shuffle.db` and no API key) if omitted.

   **Dig channel setup:** when `DIG_CHANNEL_ID` is set, all `/dig *` invocations
   must happen in that channel (or a thread under it) and public dig output
   posts there. To also hide the slash commands from other channels, restrict
   the bot's integration in Discord: Server Settings → Integrations → Cama MM →
   Channels.

6. **Invite bot to your server:**
   - In Discord Developer Portal, go to OAuth2 > URL Generator
   - Select scopes: `bot` and `applications.commands`
   - Select bot permissions as listed in step 4
   - Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser to invite the bot

## Running the Bot

```bash
uv run python bot.py
```

The bot will connect to Discord and sync slash commands automatically.
