# Cama Balanced Shuffle Discord Bot

A Discord bot for balanced team shuffling in Dota 2 inhouse games for the Camaraderous league.

## Features

- **Discord Bot Integration**: Full Discord bot with slash commands
- **Balanced Team Matching**: Minimizes team value difference using Glicko-2 ratings with role-based optimization
- **Lobby System**: React-based lobby system for matchmaking (⚔️ to join/leave)
- **Win/Loss Tracking**: Tracks match results for statistics and Glicko-2 rating updates
- **Role Distribution**: Role-based balancing with off-role penalties
- **Match Recording**: Record match results with Radiant/Dire team support
- **Betting System**: Jopacoin wagering on match outcomes
- **Leaderboard**: Track player rankings by jopacoin balance
- **SQLite Database**: Lightweight database with automatic migrations

## How It Works

The bot uses a **Glicko-2 rating system** for team balancing. Players are matched to create fair teams that minimize skill difference while optimizing role assignments.

- Teams are balanced using Glicko-2 ratings (or MMR as fallback)
- Role-based optimization ensures players are matched to their preferred positions
- Off-role penalties encourage proper role distribution
- Win/loss records update player ratings after each match

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository or navigate to the project directory**

2. **Create virtual environment and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   uv venv
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Set up Discord Bot:**
   - Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
   - Create a new application
   - Go to "Bot" section and create a bot
   - Copy the bot token
   - Enable the following Privileged Gateway Intents:
     - MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT
     - SERVER MEMBERS INTENT

4. **Configure Bot Permissions:**
   - In the OAuth2 > URL Generator section, select:
     - `bot` scope
     - `applications.commands` scope
     - Permissions: Send Messages, Use Slash Commands, Read Message History

5. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a file named `.env` in the project root (same folder as `bot.py`)
   - Add your Discord bot token and admin allowlist (comma-separated Discord user IDs):
     ```
     DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
     ADMIN_USER_IDS=123456789012345678,234567890123456789
     ```
     If `ADMIN_USER_IDS` is empty, no one is treated as an allowlisted admin for commands like `/addfake`.
   - Optional variables you can include:
     ```
     DB_PATH=/path/to/cama_shuffle.db   # overrides the default sqlite file
     OPENDOTA_API_KEY=your_opendota_key  # unlocks the 1200 req/min rate limit
     ```
     Both default to sane values (`cama_shuffle.db` and no API key) if omitted.

6. **Invite bot to your server:**
   - In Discord Developer Portal, go to OAuth2 > URL Generator
   - Select scopes: `bot` and `applications.commands`
   - Select bot permissions: `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `Add Reactions`, `Use External Emojis`
   - Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser to invite the bot

## Running the Bot

```bash
uv run python bot.py
```

The bot will connect to Discord and sync slash commands automatically.
