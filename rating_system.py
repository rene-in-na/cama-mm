        Update ratings after a match using team-based expected outcome with individual RD.

        V3 approach (fixes V2 RD² concentration issues):
        1. Expected outcome is TEAM vs TEAM (not individual vs team)
        2. Each player's delta magnitude is determined by their RD (convergence speed)
        3. Apply ±MAX_RATING_SWING_PER_GAME cap to prevent extreme outliers

        Key insight: When a team wins/loses, ALL players on that team should gain/lose
        in the same direction. The expected outcome depends on team ratings, not
        individual player rating vs opponent team.

        This prevents rating compression where:
        - Low-rated players slowly inflate (would lose less, gain more personally)
        - High-rated players slowly deflate (would gain less, lose more personally)

        - New player (RD 350): ±150-200 (capped at MAX_RATING_SWING_PER_GAME)
