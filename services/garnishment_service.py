        Add income to a player, applying garnishment if they have debt.

        When a player has a negative balance, a portion of their income is
        "garnished" to pay down the debt. The full amount is credited to
        their balance, but the return value shows the garnishment breakdown.

        Args:
            discord_id: Player's Discord ID
            amount: Income amount (bet winnings, participation reward, etc.)
            guild_id: Guild ID for multi-guild support
            bankruptcy_penalty_rate: When > 0, the repo fuses a bankruptcy
                penalty debit into the same atomic txn, computing the penalty
                from the live post-garnishment net. Pass 0.0 (default) to
                skip. Callers must decide whether the player is *eligible*
                for a penalty (e.g. ``penalty_games > 0``) and pass the rate
                only when they are — this service is policy-agnostic about
                eligibility and just forwards the coefficient.

        Returns:
            Dict with:
            - gross: Original income amount
            - garnished: Amount conceptually going toward debt repayment
            - net: Amount the player "feels" (gross - garnished - penalty)
            - bankruptcy_penalty: Amount debited for the penalty (0 if none)
