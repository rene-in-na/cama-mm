"""
Comprehensive tests for ALL commands to ensure guild_id is properly handled.

These tests verify that:
1. guild_id is extracted from interaction.guild.id BEFORE any service/repo calls
2. All repository and service method calls include guild_id where required
3. Commands don't have UnboundLocalError patterns

This uses static analysis of the source code to catch patterns where guild_id
is used before being defined.
